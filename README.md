# ⚡ Jazika ⚡

_Empowering individuals with transparent, accessible, and inclusive financial services_

Jazika is an effort to build a borderless, customer-centric, all in one platform to serve as a trusted companion to manage and grow money while giving back control to users. By simplifying web3 for the less tech and financial savvy, we intend to increase utilization of financial products across sub-saharan Africa. The “take it or leave it” approach to financial products and pricing has locked out many, esp in the informal sector from enjoying the benefits of current financial trends.

Jazika is inspired by the utility of RoSCAs in Africa, commonly referred to as chamas in Kenya where people come together in groups to save and lend to each other. This form very interesting distribution channel for microloans and yield on saving products.

### Positive outcomes

- Interest for participating chamas.
- Credit score and credit worthiness for users.
- Real-time access to credit.
- Credit at customized terms.
